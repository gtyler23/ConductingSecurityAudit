<h1>Conducting a Security Audit</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Reviewed an IT managerâ€™s scope, goals, and risk assessment for a company's cybersecurity program from a given scenario. Then, performed an internal audit to complete a controls assessment and compliance checklist to align current business practices with industry standards and best practices by 1) ensuring all listed assets were accounted for in the controls selected; 2) appropriate administrative, technical, and physical controls were selected (marked with an X); 3) the priority level for each control selected was noted, based on the need for immediate or future implementation; and 4) ensuring compliance regulations and standards that the business needs to adhere to are selected (i.e., related to conducting business in the E.U., accepting online payments, user permission policies). Afterwards, communicated the security audit results and recommendations to stakeholders by drafting a Stakeholder memorandum to demonstrate the ability to communicate in a way that supports stakeholder understanding of complex concepts.
